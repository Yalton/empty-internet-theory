## What is it? 

Dead internet theory is the theory that the vast majority of the users on the internet are not real, but instead bots, this application will serve as both an exploratory research of this idea as well as a way for users to test their chops at identifying these bots

## How does it work? 

New Visitors to the site will be greeted with a lobby interface where they can start a new session; once in this session they can invite their friends to a lobby

Minimum participants is set at 4; Maximum participants is set to 100

Once everyone is in the lobby the game can start; upon starting of the game each player will be prompted to customize their initial profile; this will be very simple, essentially Just include a Profile picture, Fake Username, Fake Bio.

Upon the creation of this profile the user will then be prompted to create 5 Posts on the spot; these posts are text only and character limited. The goal of these posts is to attempt to disguise yourself as a bot; you should create posts that make it seem as though you are not a Human

After all users are done creating their posts the game begins. The game is quite simple; it consists of scrolling through a feed of posts containing both human and bot generated content. The players objective is to identify who is a human, and who is a bot

The game works off a score system; every player starts with 1 points, and works to accrue points by guessing correctly who is a bot and who is a human

## Point exchange

The point exchange is quite simple

Guessing correctly will remove one point from the player or bot and award you one point in exchange

Guessing incorrectly does the opposite, removing one point from your own score and adding it to the score of the player or bot who fooled you.

If a player or bots score falls to zero; they will be removed from the game and all of their posts will be removed from all players feeds.

Players and bots can continue to add posts as the game goes on in order to convince other users that they are a bot, this has risks and rewards as you may out yourself as human, or further convince other users that you are a bot.

The game will continue until there is only one human player remaining

Their score will then be saved in a leaderboard and displayed on the front page if it is sufficiently high
